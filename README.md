# krypt-asn1-rb

Seeks to provide an implementation for Krypt::ASN1 written entirely in Ruby. If
performance is acceptable, it will ultimately replace the current native
implementations. We would still keep them around as separate, supplemental
providers, though - in case you need every last bit of performance.
